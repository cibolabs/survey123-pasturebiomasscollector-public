      <hint>&lt;p&gt;The Cibo-Biomass Collector App is a simple mobile data collection app for undertaking rapid pasture assessments in the paddock.

&lt;p&gt;The Transect location will be set to the middle qudrat, with all the data ready to be used for direct input to forage budgets, or for calibration of satellite imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
